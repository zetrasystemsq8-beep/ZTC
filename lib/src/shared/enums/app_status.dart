/// Represents the async lifecycle state of any data/operation.

/// Use this in state classes across all state management patterns (Riverpod,

/// Usage:
/// ```dart
/// // In your state class
/// AppStatus status = AppStatus.initial;
///
/// // In your UI
/// switch (status) {
///   AppStatus.initial => const SizedBox.shrink(),
///   AppStatus.loading => const AppLoading(),
///   AppStatus.success => YourContentWidget(),
///   AppStatus.failure => AppErrorWidget(onRetry: _load),
/// }
/// ```
enum AppStatus {
  /// No operation started yet — initial empty state.
  initial,

  /// Async operation in progress.
  loading,

  /// Operation completed successfully.
  success,

  /// Operation failed.
  failure,
